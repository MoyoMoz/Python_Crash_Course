# message = "I'm starting the try it yourself sections all over again and that kind of sucks but now there's structure to it"
# print(message)

# 2-2. Simple Messages: Store a message in a variable, and print that message.
# Then change the value of your variable to a new message, and print the new message.

# message = "Maybe doing it this way will not only help me but someone else too. That's my hope"
# print(message)


# 2-3. Personal Message: Store a person's name in a variable, and print a message to that person.
# Your message should be simple, such as, "Hello Eric, would you like to learn some Python today?"

# name = "Fabio"
# message = "You remind me of someone I used to know"
# print(f"{name} {message}")


# 2-4. Name Cases: Store a person's name in a variable, and then print that person's name in lowercase, uppercase, and titlecase.

# 2-5. Famous Quote: Find a quote from a famous person you admire. Print the quote and the name of its author.

# print("Moyo once said 'I'm sleepy and I want to go to bed but I'm here instead'")

# 2-6. Famous Quote 2: Repeat Exercise 2-5, but this time store the famous person's name in a variable called famous_person.
# Then compose your message and store it in a new variable called message. Print your message.

famous_person = "Moyo"
message = "You remind me of someone I used to know"
print(f"{famous_person} {message}")

# 2-7. Stripping Names: Store a person's name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name.
# Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once.
# Print the name once, so the whitespace around the name is displayed.
# Then print the name using each of the three stripping functions, lstrip(), rstrip(), and strip().
