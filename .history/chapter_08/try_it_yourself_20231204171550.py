#     print("I love this book I'm learning about functions!")

# display_message()

# 8-2. Favorite Book: Write a function called favorite_book() that accepts one
# parameter, title. The function should print a message, such as One of my

#           size {shirt_size} message will read {shirt_text}''')


# make_shirt('Small', 'Yolo')
# make_shirt(shirt_size='Large', shirt_text='Paris')

# make_shirt(shirt_text='Python is great', shirt_size='Small')

# 8-5. Cities: Write a function called describe_city() that accepts the name of a
# city and its country. The function should print a simple sentence, such as
# Reykjavik is in Iceland. Give the country parameter a default value. Call your
# function for three different cities, at least one of which is not in the default
# country.

# def describe_city(city_name, country='France',):
#     print(f"{city_name}, which is in {country} is a chill place to visit")

# describe_city("Varcie")

# 8-6. City Names: Write a function called city_country() that takes in the name
# of a city and its country. The function should return a string formatted like
# this: "Santiago, Chile". Call your function with at least three city-country pairs,

# 8-7. Album: Write a function called make_album() that builds a dictionary
# describing a music album. The function should take in an artist name and an
# album title, and it should return a dictionary containing these two pieces of
# information. Use the function to make three dictionaries representing different
# albums. Print each return value to show that the dictionaries are storing the
# album information correctly. Use None to add an optional parameter to make_album()
# that allows you to store the number of songs on an album. If the calling line
# includes a value for the number of songs, add that value to the album's dictionary.
# Make at least one new function call that includes the number of songs on an album.

# def make_album(artist_name, album_title, number_of_songs=None):
#     album = {"artist": artist_name, "album": album_title}
#     if number_of_songs:
#         album["song_amount"] = number_of_songs
#     return album


# album_1 = make_album('Joan', 'Folk Glory', '7')
# album_2 = make_album('Joan', 'Folk Story 1')
# album_3 = make_album('Joan', 'Folk Forever')
# print(album_1, album_2, album_3)


# 8-8. User Albums: Start with your program from Exercise 8-7. Write a while loop
# that allows users to enter an album's artist and title. Once you have that
# information, call make_album() with the user's input and print the dictionary
# that's created. Be sure to include a quit value in the while loop.

# 8-9. Messages: Make a list containing a series of short text messages. Pass the
# list to a function called show_messages(), which prints each text message.

# 8-10. Sending Messages: Start with a copy of your program from Exercise 8-9.
# Write a function called send_messages() that prints each text message and moves
# each message to a new list called sent_messages as it's printed. After calling the
# function, print both of your lists to make sure the messages were moved correctly.

# 8-11. Archived Messages: Start with your work from Exercise 8-10. Call the
# function send_messages() with a copy of the list of messages. After calling the
# function, print both of your lists to show that the original list has retained its
# messages.

# items a person wants on a sandwich. The function should have one parameter that
